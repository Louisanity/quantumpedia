## Research Interests

My research focuses on distributed quantum computing, with emphasis on algorithm design, resource-efficient execution, and fault tolerance across networked systems. I am particularly interested in developing distributed quantum error correction codes and scalable protocols applicable to optimisation, machine learning, and quantum simulation. This work bridges quantum algorithms and high-performance computing, contributing to the advancement of hybrid and fault-tolerant quantum architectures.
